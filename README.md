# IdleGameWithMonsters

[Play the game](https://lambertschulze.github.io/IdleGameWithMonsters/) in your browser.

## What and Why?

I had some Demo of the PokéAPI around because of [@phryneas](https://github.com/phryneas) [RTK Query Course](https://egghead.io/courses/rtk-query-basics-query-endpoints-data-flow-and-typescript-57ea3c43).

Then [some Dunkey Quote](https://youtu.be/c66IR3qA5-w?feature=shared&t=17) hit me:

> (Pokémon doesn't) require any reflexes or skill, or any brain power, really, to be bested.
> It's just: _"Select the first move on the menu and spam it, until the other thing dies."_

That's when I thought _"Maybe you could make some little Pokémon Idle game"_

## Future Plans for this thing

- [x] Get to minimum Tracer Bullet Stage
- [x] Damage is dealt the Pokémon way
- [x] Animations for attacking and ~taking damage~ battle transitions
- [x] After winning a battle the Pokémon on the next stage is one level up
- [x] Winning a battle gives Experience points
- [x] You can level up your own Pokémon
- [ ] While going through stages you encounter Pokémon from the game regions
- [x] Encountering Pokémon fills your Pokédex
- [ ] You can catch Pokémon
- [ ] You can add cought Pokémon to your team
- [ ] Stats for a Stats Page
- [ ] Achivements

Let's see how far I will take this :D
